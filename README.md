# Type-level computations within TypeScript

### What?
This repository <b>does not contain</b> any library/frameworks/production code.

This repository contains TypeScript code that attempts to execute some computations on a type-level. <b>Its purpose is purely didactic</b>.

### Why?
To fully understand the TypeScript's type system and play with it I tryed to rewrite some basic arithmetic computations working on a type level.

I was inspired by:
- [fwcd/tylude](https://github.com/fwcd/tylude)
- [Ryan Dabler's article](https://itnext.io/implementing-arithmetic-within-typescripts-type-system-a1ef140a6f6f)

### To Do
- `LessThanEqual<N, M>`
- `LessThan<N, M>`
- `GreatherThan<N, M>`
- `Min<N, M>`
- `Product<N, M>`
- `Raised<N, M>`
- `Quotient<N, M>`
